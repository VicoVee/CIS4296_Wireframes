# Genomic Music – Interactive DNA-to-Music Demo

An interactive, client-side experience that transforms DNA sequences into music. Runs entirely in the browser with realistic hardcoded data—no backend required.

## What It Does
- Choose species and genes.
- Map DNA bases to musical notes.
- Assign instruments to species.
- Configure musical settings and play a “genomic symphony.”
- View an onboarding team modal on first load.
- Play compositions without login (saving requires login).

## How to Run
1. Download the project.
2. Open **version8.html** in a modern web browser.
3. Use the click-through interface to create and play symphonies.

## Quick Tour
1. **Welcome & Team:** Intro modal on first load.  
2. **Home:** Create a new symphony or view saved ones.  
3. **Creation Flow:**  
   - Select species group → species  
   - Assign instruments  
   - Select gene  
   - Choose musical key and DNA-to-music settings  
   - Review and play  
4. **Player:** Play/pause, see tracks, view instrument assignments.  
5. **Saved Compositions:** Requires login to save; playback is open.

## Notes
- Data is hardcoded to simulate real genomic content.
- No installs, servers, or API keys are needed.
- Earlier prototypes are included: home.html, version2–7.html.
